# Responsive Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to create a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design that looks great on all screen sizes.

The website includes a hero section, an about me section, a list of my sample projects, and a contact form. It also uses Font Awesome icons and Google Fonts to improve the overall look and feel.

I created this as part of my internship task to practice responsive web design using media queries, flexbox, and grid layout. The site is fully responsive and adjusts well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Feel free to explore the code and design. Feedback is always welcome!
